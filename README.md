# Touchless-Water-Dispenser
**by Jayvind Baghel.**

Lots of water is wasted due to its improper use for washing hands. This adds up to a considerable amount in public place like hospitals, airports, railway stations, hostels, and restaurants.
Generally, people do not rub their hands with soap for the required 20 seconds before washing them with running water. Or they leave the tap running also while they are rubbing their hands with soap. This proposed system can help solve both these problems.
In addition, touching of the water tap by different people can spread the germs. So, this touchless water tap will take care of that as well.
